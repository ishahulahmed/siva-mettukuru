if the orignal list is affected by performing an operation it is called inplace operation

# Append element to the list
sample_list = ["Ansible", "Terraform", "Jenkins", "Docker", "K8s"] 
sample_list.append("Shell") # inplace operation 
print(sample_list)


append --> appends to the end of a existing list as a list. if tried to append more than one element ['apple', 'ball', ['cat, 'dog']] 
extend --> appends to the end of a existing list as an individual item ['apple', 'ball', 'cat', 'dog']

- To know whether a datatype is mutable or not, perform adding or changing elements to it.

- Immutable datatypes: tuple, strings
- Mutable datatypes: list, dict, set
