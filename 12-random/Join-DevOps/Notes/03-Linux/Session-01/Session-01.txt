What is DevOps?

Book or Internet Answer --> DevOps = Development + Operations 

What is computer?
	Laptop/Desktop/Mobile/Server == Computing Device
	
	Processor
	Ram
	Storage
	OS = Graphics + Kernel = Linux not windows (OS for Servers no Grpahics)
	Why servers will not have graphics 

Laptop/Desktop = Internet surfing + Development + Songs + movies = daily use
Mobile = Apps + Internet + calling
Server = to server the application

more graphics = more memory + more power + more time

Server = less memory + less power + less AC + less time + less cost (it should consume)
Servers are more powerful to server many requests as they have more powerful Processor + Ram + Storage

Client and Server
-------------------
in or internet world, everything is a computer

we have a Lawyer , we are clients for him

legal service, so we are clients

who gives info = service provider
who requests info = client

client server not on the basis of size but on the basis of request and service

laptop = client (diagram)
server = facebook

laptop = client (diagram)
mobile = server

mobile = client (diagram)
laptop = server

What is DevOps?
-----------------

before independence
--------------------
stakeholders --> who are part of system
school = students, parents, teachers

ideally 100% students should get pass

only one final exam 50 years back

student = he will not study from DAY-1
teachers = teachers may not focus to complete syllabus from DAY-1
parents = they always worried about their children from DAY-1

clients == parents

pass percentage was very less

30 years back
--------------------
unit-I, unit-II, quarterly, unit-III, Half yearly, unit-IV, grand test and final test

student = student may start study JUL 1st week
teachers = teachers will start focus on lessons
parents = they will wait until JUL 3rd week

everybody will analyse results.

100 --> 31 members got 31% (33% is needed to Pass), 69% (69% passed)

unit-II --> 72%
III --> 75%
Final --> 95% (Here there are 7 Chances before final exam for the students to improve) (here parents need not worry till last exam like previous)

15 year back
-------------------
daily slip tests

DAY-1 we teach something
DAY-2 we will conduct exam, max 5 questions

students = they start studying from DAY-1
teachers =  they start teaching from DAY-1
parents = they can see results from DAY-1

99.99%

process improvement is the key for best results

whatsapp --> 2011
whatsapp --> 2024

process improvement happened in whatsapp system...

SDLC --> Software Development Lifecycle
Requirements gathering --> what our customers want
Analysis --> Analyse the requirements
Design --> Start designing the project, customers will accept the designing
Develop/implementation --> Implement the designing
Deployment
Test --> Test the design and everything
Maintainance --> 

ChatGPT
---------
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. It ensures that the software meets quality standards and customer requirements. The SDLC typically involves several phases:

1. Planning: Define the scope, objectives, and resources needed. Develop a project plan and schedule.

2. Analysis: Gather and analyze requirements from stakeholders. Document what the system needs to do.

3. Design: Create architectural and detailed designs for the system. This includes defining system components, user interfaces, and data structures.

4. Development: Write and compile the code based on the design specifications. This phase involves actual coding and unit testing.

5. Testing: Evaluate the system to find and fix bugs. Perform various tests such as integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

6. Deployment: Release the software to the production environment where it can be used by end-users.

7. Maintenance: Provide ongoing support and updates. Address any issues or enhancements needed post-deployment.

Different methodologies can be applied to these phases, such as Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, or DevOps, depending on the project's needs and goals.

Waterfall --> water is falling to down
Construction is over --> but testing is failed, output is not as per the design
Demolish the house, start again

50% construction is over --> now customer wants some change in design

disadvantages
---------------
it can't accomodate new requirements
final product output is only at the end

IT--> Waterfall
----------------
students = developers
parents = clients
teachers = testing team

developers, testers, clients

2 or 3 years (Project Duration)

developers = no development from DAY-1
testers = no testing from DAY-1
clients = worried

after 1 year they start serious development

few employees will resign, new employees will come = KT

started development

testing what to do? reading 100's of pages from client requirement and planning test cases...

development is completed in DEV env, developers tesed it is good

testing environment --> under pressure. raise more and more defects

started fights between developers and testers

100 defects --> 80 defects valid, 20 defects invalid

lot of emails between developers and testers..involving team leaders.. involving managers .. account head

clients == Ferrari (Client Expenctation) == Maruthi 800 (Actually Developed)

main disadvantage in watefall --> you cannot insert new requirements. you have to wait until the final product is delivered.

Agile
--------
start with small things --> keep short goals
divide the system into small modules
signup and login
product catalogue
cart
payment
delivery

sprints and modules

Sprint-1 may be for 1 month
---------------------------
signup and login

developers = they start from DAY-1 = 1.5 week for development
testers = 1.5 week for testing
1 week for deployment

1.5 weeks = developers concentration is more
testers = focus is less during 1.5 of weeks of development because product is not ready and vice versa

10 defects --> 8 valid, 2 invalid

again same fight

90% completed, 10% pending

Sprint-2 product catalogue
---------------------------
10% backlog (complete 10% backlog of sprint 1 along with sprint 2)


Sprint-final
---------------------------
ferrari == Honda City


2016 --> too much load on servers (once jio came in 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------
daily slip test = daily testing

Sprint-1 = process improvement
-------------------------------
DAY-1 he developed a code for

Enter your First Name

DAY-1 ask testing team to test this small code

positive and negative (test cases)

1. enter the name in 20 char (positive)
2. enter the numbers in the name field (negative)

10 test cases --> 

DAY-2 ==> no chance of raising invalid defects. 3 valid defects.
Developers and testers will communicate


if the code developed is built and tested on the same day then you can call it as DevOps ==> We use tools to make it fast and reliable

Businesses will aim for
1. Faster releases to the market
2. Less defects

Increasing this speed and accuracy is DevOps Process

amazon vs flipkart
-------------------
every 11.2sec they do one release, fully automated with less defects (amazon is winner)

manual testing --> automated testing
build and deployment --> 

deployment --> automate
------------
1.0 --> running
deployment means
download the new version
stop the sytem
remove old version
install new version
start the system

DevOps and cloud two wheels for a bike
--------------------------------------
if you say i will use only DevOps in on premise then you will not get 100% Automation.
if you say i am in cloud but i will not use DevOps again you will not get 100% Automation.
For Complete Automation DevOps and Cloud is So much Important. 

Newly Starting Companies are not looking rent a room, install servers, provide power, keep a security guard and put Air Conditioners. No one are looking to do that. Because that is more costly for them and that is not there responsibility.

if you starting a restaurant business then restaurant is your main focus. putting servers in a room that is additional responsibilty. even if you lose some money we should focus on our responsibility that is the achievement of cloud.

What is DevOps?
---------------
DevOps is a process improvement. What DevOps say is whatever the code is developed by the developer that should be built and test on the same day.

What is improving here using DevOps?
------------------------------------
We improve communication between the communication between the developers and testers their efficieny becoming more. There are no fights between the teams. Product delivery is 100% accurate. These are the advantages we got through DevOps.

Server
---------
Windows vs Linux --> Linux
Super computers also use linux

everything is command here --> everything is text

Linux can run for years without restart (if a server restarts site will down and customers cannot access your site)
less power
less bandwidth
less memory
100% free
fast

We will start learning Linux

AWS account create --> free trail
500-1000rs per month
if more bill --> ask AWS they will refund
1 Lakh --> please refund

who owns the debit card
use the same name on the card, for email, firstname and lastname also
and address also same as bank debit card address
and check online usage is enabled or not for debit card

1 year (free trial) --> not everything is free

8GB RAM is mandatory for this course

Linux --> vim editor, cut and awk, user management, package management
Resume is not 1 day task it is continous task

core values of the concepts will never change learn concepts not tools
now jenkis few years some other so learn concept not tool
